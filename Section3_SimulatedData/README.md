This folder contains pipeline scripts used to simulate realistic P1 waveforms for Section 3 of Mon et al. (submitted). We simulated 1,000 datasets for three combinations of peak amplitude magnitudes and real noise profiles: a simulated 10 µV peak combined with preschooler noise, a simulated 20 µV peak combined with preschooler noise, and a simulated 20 µV peak combined with infant noise. For each peak amplitude/noise profile combination, an equal number of subjects were assigned to the two orienting speed groups (High/Low) and the two age groups (Younger/Older) with 12 subjects per cell. Each subject saw 1 emotion condition (Neutral) with 5 unique actors, and each emotion condition/actor combination was presented for 10 trials.
